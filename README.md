# Inspiration
Inspiration was to help an illiterte person educate himslef with the basics of reading and writing without the aid of any teacher. In remote areas, where people donot have access to educators, this application can prove to useful.  

# What it does
1. Identifies the objects shown to it, counts the number of objects and spells them out. This helps the illiterate person learn how to count, identify and learn the alphabet through spellings.

2. Displays a series of images of alphabets on screen and asks the person to identify it. Also tells whether the identification is correct or not.

3. Speaks an alphabet for the user to write it on the paper, captures the image of the alphabet and checks whether it matches with the asked alphabet or not.

4. Helps the person to read a book by taking in the image of the captured page of the book and reading it aloud.

# How we built it
The front end was entirely made using pySimpleGUI. YOLO was used as object detection system. Pyttsx3 was used for text to audio and google sound API was used for audio to text.
